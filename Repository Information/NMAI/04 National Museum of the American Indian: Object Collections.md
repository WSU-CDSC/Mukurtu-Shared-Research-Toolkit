# National Museum of the American Indian: Object Collections 

While the Archives and Object Collections are both housed in the Cultural Resource Center and refer to one another in a variety of ways, they are managed by different departments. Although we recommend you contact the Reference Archivist for inquiries regarding object collections, they will most likely redirect that request internally to NMAI Collections staff who will then be in touch with you directly.

## Accessing the Object Collections

In addition to Collections staff, the Reference Archivist may also direct you to the [" **Accessing the Object Collections"**](https://americanindian.si.edu/explore/collections/accessing#:~:text=For%20appointments%20to%20access%20the%20NMAI%20Archive%20Center%20collections%20(paper,images%2C%20contact%20the%20Archive%20Center.&text=To%20request%20a%20research%20appointment,form%20via%20the%20links%20below.)page online where you can find additional contact information and request forms for:

- Object Collections Research
- Object Collections Report
- Cultural Resources Center Tour

### Things to Keep in Mind
Many, if not all objects at NMAI have related materials in the NMAI Archives. These may be things like notes from collectors, receipts, and other forms of documentation. These materials will **not** be returned with the Object Report. However, you can take object IDs from the Report and follow-up with the Reference Archivist to inquire about any related material.

Please note that the information listed here pertains specifically to the NMAI Object Collections. If you are interested in visiting the NMAI Archival Collections, please see the** ["In Person Research Visit"]section of this toolkit or email [nmaiarchives@si.edu](mailto:nmaiarchives@si.edu) with your inquiry.

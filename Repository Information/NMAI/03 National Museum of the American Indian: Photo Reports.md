# National Museum of the American Indian: Photo Reports  

The Reference Archivist and Archives team oversees both the archival and photograph collections. Although both are houses in the NMAI-Archives, archival materials and photo collections are cataloged separately. If you are interested in photographs, the NMAI Reference Archivist can generate a Photo Report from their internal digital asset management system using designated keywords such as culture group, photographer, geographic location, or topic.

To request a photo report, please follow these steps to connect with the Reference Archivist:

1. Contact the NMAI Reference Archivist at the NMAI Archives Center via email at [**nmaiarchives@si.edu.**](mailto:nmaiarchives@si.edu)At the moment the Reference Archivist is Nathan Sowry.

2. In your email be sure to include:
  1. Brief description of project (optional).
  2. Tribal affiliation, if any.
  3. Culture group(s) of interest.

3. The Reference Archivist will follow up by email with the photo report(s) attached as a PDF containing both the media and corresponding metadata.

While most photos in the NMAI Archives are digitized, some are not. If one of these undigitized photos appears in your Photo Report (often as a digitized index card), please follow these steps to contact the reference archivist about digitization.

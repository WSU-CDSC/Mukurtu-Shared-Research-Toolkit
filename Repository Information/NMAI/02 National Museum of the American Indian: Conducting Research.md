# National Museum of the American Indian: Conducting Research  

In terms of conducting research, one of the wonderful things about the NMAI collections is that almost all of their archival material is digitized! Therefore, the majority of materials can be accessed remotely and do not require an in-person visit to consult the collections. However, there is a small group of collections that are not digitized. If you are interested in these undigitized collections, the NMAI staff have workarounds to accessing collections remotely and can often provide alternative forms of access.

The high level of digitization and accessibility is in part due to their relatively small amount of collections materials (which is much less than any of the Library of Congress divisions, for example). But it is largely due to NMAI's overarching mission statement, which is to make the Indigenous and Native American collections held in the NMAI institution accessible to the Indigenous and Native communities from which the materials originated. This framework – to prioritize accessibility of Indigenous collections to Indigenous communities – is not the case for many of the other federal repositories, not just in Washington DC but throughout the country. So, if you are conducting research at other institutions, you may find accessing the collections materials is a more traditional process and a bit more of a challenge.

## Online Catalogs

Material held at the National Museum of the American Indian is discoverable on two online catalogs:

Collections Search Center (Smithsonian Institution)

[https://collections.si.edu/search/](https://collections.si.edu/search/)

Smithsonian Online Virtual Archive (SOVA)

[https://sova.si.edu/](https://sova.si.edu/)

To include in a short demo video:

- Locating online catalogs
  - Where to find them from a general google search or from the NAA website
- Navigating online catalogs (Collections Search & SOVA)
  - Short demo video might be best way to explain this rather than a bunch of screenshots?
- Narrowing searches down
  - Using the "archival repository" or "type" or "culture" parameters on the online catalog
- Identifying digitized content in catalogs
  - Look for the blue box icon labeled "digitized content" next to the collection name
- Search terms (specific to what works best for NAA)
  - Culture group, tribal community name, collector, artist, linguist, language, place name, geographical location

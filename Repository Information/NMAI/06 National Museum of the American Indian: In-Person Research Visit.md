# National Museum of the American Indian: In-Person Research Visit  

If you are planning an in-person research visit, conducting preliminary research and exploring the institutional websites and online catalogs is perhaps the most important thing you can do *before* you arrive. This will allow you to dive right into consulting collections and maximize your time, particularly if your visit is short (maybe only a couple days). However, we know that visiting in-person may prove to be a challenge and may not be logistically feasible, particularly for Native communities.

For those visiting in-person to conduct research in the archives, each repository or institution has their own policies, practices, and processes for visiting. Specifics for visiting the NMAI archives are as follows:

## Hours
The NMAI Archives is currently open to researchers by appointment only Monday â€“ Friday from 9:30am to 4:30pm.

## Scheduling an Appointment
Due to restrictions on reading room capacity, research visits to the NMAI archives are **by appointment only.** The NMAI archives requires appointments be made at least 5 days in advance. However, we recommend scheduling your appointment as far in advance as possible as capacity in the reading room is limited and spots may fill up quickly.

To request an in-person research appointment, please contact the NMAI Reference Archivist via email at [namiarchives@si.edu](mailto:namiarchives@si.edu).

In your email be sure to include:
* The date(s) you would like to visit.
* Collections or materials you are interested in consulting.
* Brief description of project (optional).
* Tribal affiliation, if any.

The Reference Archivist or another NMAI staff will be in touch via email usually within 3-5 business days to schedule your research visit.

## Front Desk Sign-in
The NMAI archives reading room is located within the Cultural Resource Center (CRC). Upon entering the CRC, you will need to check-in with the front desk security guard. Let them know your name and that you have a scheduled research appointment in the archives.

If you are bringing in any technological devices or equipment larger than a cell phone, you will need to register your devices in the sign-in book located on the security desk counter. You will need to note your name, date, time of arrival, and the equipment you are bringing in such as laptops, iPads, cameras, etc. You will not be permitted to leave the building with any unregistered items, including your personal laptop.

The Reference Archivist or another NMAI staff member will usually greet you in the rotunda when you arrive. They can assist you with the sign-in process and will then show you to the reading room. In the unlikely event that no staff member is present, simply let the front desk guard know that you have a research appointment and they will contact a staff member to come and meet you.

***Should you wish to leave the building for any reason, please let the Reference Archivist know before exiting. For security purposes, you will need to check-in with the front desk guard upon re-entry and an NMAI staff member will need to accompany you back into the reading room.***

## Reading Room Policies
As is standard practice, most (if not all) archival reading rooms and repositories have a set of basic reading room policies that all researchers and visitors must adhere to. For the NMAI archives, some things of note to keep in mind are:

Personal items such backpacks or purses are not allowed at the reading room tables. Additionally, outer garments such as large coats, hats, and gloves are not permitted while consulting material. The reading room has a set of lockers as well as a coat rack you can use to store your belongings during your visit.

No food or beverages of any kind are allowed at the tables in the reading room. This includes tobacco and gum, as well as water bottles and travel mugs (even if they have a lid). Any food or beverage you have must remain in the locker area. Additionally, no pens, highlighters, or post-it notes are allowed.

Additionally, cameras and scanners are not permitted anywhere in the NMAI archives due to conservation concerns and copyright restrictions.

Materials that you can bring with you to the tables in the reading room are:
* Pencils
* Paper
* Laptops
* Chargers
* Digital Camera, iPad, phone etc.

Once you arrive at the reading room, each researcher will be asked to sign the National Museum of the American Indian Archives Center [Researcher Registration Form](/Repository%20Information/NMAI/NMAI%20Archives%20Center%20Researcher%20Registration.pdf). The form includes your contact information, the collections you consult during your visit, details about handling collections material, and information regarding access, copying, and reproduction. The Reference Archivist will have you fill out this Researcher Registration Form at the start of your visit, but it is shared here for your reference.

## Consulting Collections
As is standard practice in most archival reading rooms, the NMAI Reference Archivist will brief you on specific policies for handling and consulting the collections before you begin your in-person visit. Researchers are allowed a maximum of one cart at a time containing collections of interest. If you are interested in a lot of material, you will need to prioritize which material you would like to request first. Depending on the collection, some will be delivered one folder at a time or one box at a time.

For manuscript or written material, be aware that NMAI requests you remove one folder at a time from a document box or collections box and asks that you make sure to preserve the order of the folders. If you notice that any of the material is damaged, out of order, or missing please let the Reference Archivist know. For photographs, NMAI provides gloves for you to use when handling and consulting the materials.

It is also important to note that as the researcher, you will be asked to accept responsibility for returning all the contents to the correct folder or collection in the same condition they were delivered to you.

## Access & Copyright Restrictions
Researchers should be aware that the NMAI archives has several access and copyright restrictions and policies. The most prominent of these is cultural sensitivity, as some material is restricted at the request of the tribal community and a researcher must receive permission from the tribal community to consult the collection. Other access restrictions include fragility of the collection and special format issues, so it is always good to check with the Reference Archivist for any potential access restrictions before scheduling your visit.

## Food Options
The CRC does not offer any food options, so we highly recommend bringing your own food from home. A refrigerator, a microwave, and a water bottle refilling station are available to researchers, just let the Reference Archivist know if you would like to use any of them. The CRC does offer several indoor and outdoor seating areas that are available to researchers and visitors.

For visitors with a car, there are several food options in the surrounding Suitland area, although all are outside the gates and not within walking distance.

***Keep in mind: No food of any kind is permitted in the reading room or while actively consulting collections. If you would like to take a snack or water break, please let the Reference Archivist know and they will show you to an area where food and beverage is allowed.***

## Contract Researcher
We know that visiting the NMAI archives in-person can be a challenge for many tribal communities, and as a result, a barrier to accessing the collections. An alternative option to an in-person visit is to hire a research surrogate already located in the DC area, who can visit the archives and conduct research on your behalf. However, we know that this option may present a host of challenges; collaboratively, financially, or otherwise.

If you are considering hiring a contract researcher or this is a barrier you encounter, please contact the Reference Archivist and explain your situation. Unlike many other repositories, the NMAI archives has the ability to digitize most of their archival material in-house at no cost for tribal communities. As a result, you may be able to conduct your research from a fully remote posture.

***Keep in mind: If you would like to hire a contract researcher, we recommend getting in touch with the Reference Archivist, as they may have a list of contract researchers in the area they can suggest to you. This applies to not only the Smithsonian Institution, but other archives and repositories as well.***

# National Museum of the American Indian: Feedback & Follow Up  

The institutional metadata or information accompanying the material can often be incorrect, minimal, or even nonexistent. Given NMAI's collecting history, there is a lot of colonial and racist language both in the materials themselves and in the collection or item name, as well as misattributions and uncertain attributions.

While conducting research, many community researchers may come across material that they have additional and/or traditional knowledge of that may not be reflected in the existing institutional metadata. For example, a tribal member may be able to identify a previously unknown individual(s) in a photograph, provide a correction to the tribal affiliation given, or share knowledge about the material itself. In all cases, the NMAI welcomes any additional knowledge or corrections tribal community members may feel comfortable sharing.

Each institution has its own method for sharing this kind of information and providing this type of feedback. NMAI has an ["Information Please"](https://emailwsu.sharepoint.com/teams/libraries.cdsc/Shared%20Documents/Mukurtu/Mukurtu%20Grants/Mukurtu%20Shared%202020-2022/Research%20Toolkit%20%26%20MMTT%20Documentation/Research%20Toolkit%20Template%20Docs/RT_NMAI/Appendix%20Items/NMAI%20Archives%20Center%20Information%20Please.pdf?CT=1664467455152&OR=ItemsView) form that researchers can fill out and return to a staff member with the information they would like to share. The form includes contact information, a description of the information you would like to share, and the corresponding material.

If you are conducting in-person research, the form is available in the reading room. Simply ask the reference archivist for a copy, and it can be completed and returned during your visit.

For researchers who are unable to visit in-person, a printable version of the form is available here. Please return the completed form to the NMAI reference archivist via email ([nmaiarchives@si.edu](mailto:nmaiarchives@si.edu))

If conversations are ongoing or if additional follow-up is required, contact the staff member involved in the initial conversation directly via email, or the reference archivist at [nmaiarchives@si.edu](mailto:nmaiarchives@si.edu)

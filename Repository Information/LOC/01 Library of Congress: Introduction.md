# Library of Congress: Introduction

The Library of Congress is the largest library in the world, with millions of books, films, videos, audio recordings, photographs, newspapers, maps, and manuscripts in its collections. Today's Library of Congress is an unparalleled world resource. The collection of more than 173 million items includes more than 51 million cataloged books and other print materials in 470 languages; more than 75 million manuscripts; and the largest rare book.

For research purposes, it is important to note that the LOC has 26(?) different divisions, with each division holding a particular type of material (e.g. manuscripts, photographs, maps, recorded sound, periodicals, newspapers, etc.) As a result, before you begin your research, it is **\*very\*** helpful to have a sense of what type of material you are interested in. Then you can limit your online search results either by material type or by LOC division.

Throughout our time conducting research at the LOC, we spent time in 4 of the divisions â€“ the American Folklife Center (AFC), the Manuscripts Division (MSS), the Prints & Photographs Division (P&P), and the Geography & Maps Division (G&M). Although they are all part of the Library of Congress, each division has its own quirks, policies, and staff, as well as different collection organization, cataloguing processes, and best practices for locating relevant material (see details below). Therefore, we recommend **\*always\*** getting in touch with a reference archivist from the division you are interested in as they will know all the ins and outs of their collections and can help you identify possible collections of interest.

As vast as the LOC collections are, there is no guarantee that they will have exactly what you are looking for. Most of their Native related content was created as a result of a government directive, government interest, or government to government relations. Therefore, it is helpful to have a sense of ways the government may have been directly or indirectly involved in your topic of interest.

**Getting in Touch **

While it is always a good idea to do some preliminary online research, we also strongly recommend getting in touch with reference staff about your research subject. They are familiar with the idiosyncrasies of both the Library of Congress as a whole and their specific divisions. They also have knowledge of relevant or cognate collections that may not come up in your search.

All questions and inquiries can be made via the [Ask-a-Librarian general submission form](https://ask.loc.gov/#s-la-box-83050-container-tab0) on the Library of Congress website. If you have a sense of what type of materials you are interested in (e.g. manuscripts, photographs, maps, etc.) or regarding questions about materials you've already consulted, you can direct your question to a particular LOC division. To do so, simply click on the "Ask a specialist" tab and then select the desired division.

The specific Ask-a-Librarian pages for the 4 LOC divisions involved in the Mukurtu Shared Project are:

- AFC: [https://ask.loc.gov/american-folklife](https://ask.loc.gov/american-folklife)
- MSS: [https://ask.loc.gov/manuscripts](https://ask.loc.gov/manuscripts)
- P&P: [https://ask.loc.gov/prints-photographs/](https://ask.loc.gov/prints-photographs/)
- G&M: [https://ask.loc.gov/map-geography](https://ask.loc.gov/map-geography)

While using the Ask-a-Librarian service is the preferred method of communication, particularly if you are initiating contact with the LOC for the first time, there are often specific staff within each division that specialize in Native American collections (see the end of each above section). In your inquiry you can ask that your question be directed towards that particular staff member.

# Library of Congress: Conducting Research

"_ **Many Nations"** _

In the late 1980s, the Library of Congress published "resource guides to describe the Library's resources in special subject areas. The purpose was to connect related materials across different administrative divisions and formats and thus encourage broader public use of these invaluable collections". _Many Nations_ was the fourth such resource guide to the Library of Congress's holdings and was the result of a larger project to identify and describe the Library's vast collections related to Indigenous communities throughout North American and Alaska.

For some divisions, _Many Nations_ remains the only (or most recent) guide to Native content in their collections. Others have continued to build on these efforts and are in various stages of being able to share those. We have found that it never hurts to ask, and to specify whether a division might have a working draft that they might be able to share (as in the American Folklife Center, or Geography and Maps).

**Tips & Tricks to Searching the LOC Online Catalog**

- Limiting searches by division or material type
- Including "and" if wanting to search a phrase
- Specifically searching the finding aids
- Expand your search to include online resources – there are many for Native collections
- Try different spellings and historical names

_ **Tips to Keep in Mind:** _ While the LOC collections are extensive, some of the most well-known Native materials such as the Census Rolls and the Records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs are actually held at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Therefore, they will not come up in your LOC search results. While NARA's main location is in downtown Washington, DC, they also have regional facilities throughout the country. To locate NARA material, you can search their online catalog and we highly recommend being in touch with a NARA representative at your regional facility as well.

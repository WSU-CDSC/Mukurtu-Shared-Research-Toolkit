### Public Transport Info
* [Metro Area Transit Authority](https://www.wmata.com/service/accessibility/#main-content): Metro stations are large and fully accessible with elevators as well as extra-wide fare gates for wheelchairs. Railcars are equally accessible with ample priority seating for wheelchair users. If for some reason the elevator is not working at a station, a wheelchair-ready van will transport you to a nearby station with a working elevator or, if your destination is closer, to your destination.
* Both [Yellow Cab](https://dcyellowcab.com/wheelchair-accessible-service/) and [Royal Cab](http://dctaxionline.com/wheelchair-faqs/) offer modified minivans to transport wheelchair users. Their accessible fleet has 20 ramp-equipped vans, so be prepared to wait a little bit, or alternatively call them at least a couple hours in advance to minimize wait time – though you can't reserve a trip more than a week in advance.
* [UberWAV](https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/uberwav/): Wheelchair accessible vehicle service is being pilot-tested in DC. [GA note: I tested the interface, and you have to scroll way down in the car options to find the WAV listing. The cost was equivalent to a normal Uber request).
* [Lyft](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013081668-Accessible-vehicle-dispatch#dc): It appears you have to manually turn on an "Accessible Mode" in the app in order to call for wheelchair accessible vehicles.

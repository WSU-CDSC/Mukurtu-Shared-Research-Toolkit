# National Anthropological Archives: In-Person Research Visit

If you are planning an in-person research visit, conducting preliminary research and exploring the institutional websites and online catalogs is perhaps the most important thing you can do *before* you arrive. This will allow you to dive right into consulting collections and maximize your time, particularly if your visit is short (maybe only a couple days). However, we know that visiting in-person may prove to be a challenge and may not be logistically feasible, particularly for Native communities.

For those visiting in-person to conduct research, each repository or institution has their own policies, practices, and processes for visiting. Specifics for visiting the NAA are as follows:

# Hours
The NAA is currently open to researchers by appointment only Tuesday – Friday from 9:00am to 4:30pm.

# Appointment Request Form
* Due to restrictions on reading room capacity and ongoing NAA staff shortages, research visits to the NAA are by appointment only. We recommend scheduling your appointment as far in advance as possible, as capacity in the reading room is limited and spots may fill up quickly.
*To request a research appointment, complete and submit the online Appointment Request Form (pictured below) which can be accessed here [https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/anthropology/collections-and-archives-access/anthropology-collections-appointment-request](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/anthropology/collections-and-archives-access/anthropology-collections-appointment-request)

* Once the appointment request form has been submitted, NAA staff will be in touch via email in 3-5 business days.
* The appointment request form (above) can appear confusing at first glance, so here are a few helpful tips to keep in mind when filling it out:
  * This form is used by all the different divisions within the anthropology department – the NAA, the Human Studies Film Archives, the Cultural Object Collections, and the Biological Anthropology Collections. For NAA visits please select from among Manuscript Collections, Photographs, Sound, or Video. If you select Cultural Objects or Biological Anthropology you will be directed to a different division outside the NAA.
  * In the "please list the specific collections you would like to view" box – be sure to include as much identifying information as possible about the collections you would like to consult. In particular, the collection name, collection number (if applicable), and box number. While this is not required to submit the request form, we strongly recommend it as it will help the NAA staff to pull materials in advance so they are ready and waiting when you arrive for your visit.
  * For the "requested date(s) of use" portion – if you plan to spend several consecutive days at the NAA (e.g., Tuesday thru Friday) indicate your start and end date in the given box (there will be no need to submit this form for each day as the days are consecutive). However, if there is a break in between your visits (e.g., if you plan to come on Tuesday and Friday only), you will need to submit the form for each day as the days are non-consecutive.

## Front Desk Sign-in
The NAA reading room is located within the Museum Support Center building (MSC). Upon arrival at MSC, you will need to check-in with the guard at the front desk. Let them know your name and that you have a scheduled research appointment at the NAA. You will then receive a badge pass from the front desk guard – please keep this on you at all times for the duration of your visit.

If you are bringing in any technological devices or equipment larger than a call phone, you will also need to fill in the sign-in book located on the front desk counter. You will need to note your name, date, time of arrival, and the equipment you are bringing in such as laptops, iPads, cameras, tripods, etc. The front guard will call the NAA and a staff member will meet you out front and accompany you to the reading room.

***Make sure to keep your badge pass on you at all times, particularly if you visit the cafeteria or exit the building as you will need to show the front desk guard your pass in order to reenter.***

## Reading Room Policies
As is standard practice, most (if not all) archival reading rooms and repositories have a set of basic reading room policies that all researchers and visitors must adhere to. For the NAA, some things of note to keep in mind are:
* Personal items such backpacks or purses are not allowed at the reading room tables. Additionally, outer garments such as large coats, hats, and gloves are not permitted while consulting material. The NAA has a set of lockers as well as a coat rack you can use to store your belongings during your visit.
* No food or beverages of any kind are allowed at the tables in the reading room. This includes tobacco and gum, as well as water bottles and travel mugs (even if they have a lid). Any food or beverage you have must remain in the locker area. Additionally, no pens, highlighters, or post-it notes are allowed.
* Materials that you can bring with you to the tables in the reading room are:
  * Pencils
  * Laptops
  * Chargers
  * Digital Camera, iPad, phone etc.
  * Scrap paper (NAA has scrap paper freely available in the reading room but feel free to bring in your own as well)

Upon arrival at the NAA, each researcher will be asked to sign the National Anthropological Archives Visitor Policy Form. The form includes the points mentioned above, as well as additional details about handling collections material and copyright restrictions.
* ***Be aware that the researcher assumes all responsibility for questions of copyright, and if intending to cite materials, should credit the NAA as the source.***

## Food Options
The building has a small café with food for sale, although it is not always in service. For seating, there is an indoor cafeteria space open to all visitors for meals and snacks, as well as a set of outdoor picnic tables. There are also two microwaves and two vending machines with chips, cookies, candy, and snacks that all visitors are free to use.

Researchers and visitors should feel free to pack their own food from home. There is a shared refrigerator in the hallway just outside the reading room that you are allowed to use, along with a water fountain and a water bottle refilling station.

For visitors with a car, there are several food options in the surrounding Suitland area, although all are outside the gates and not within walking distance.

***Prior to your visit, it is a good idea to check with the NAA reference archivist to confirm if the cafeteria is open or if you will need to bring your own lunch.***

## Badges
For those doing short term research, such as researchers visiting for only a few days, the NAA will issue you a researcher badge for the duration of your visit. For any subsequent research visits, you will be issued a new researcher badge. These short-term badges will be issued at the front desk of the MSC on the first day of your visit.

For those doing longer term research, such as researchers who will be in the NAA for several consecutive months, an arrangement with the NAA may be able to be made to obtain some type of longer-term researcher badge. However, this is on a case-by-case basis and cannot be guaranteed. Please contact the NAA directly to discuss further.

## Consulting Collections
As is standard practice in most archival reading rooms, the NAA staff will brief you on specific policies for handling and consulting the collections before you begin your in-person visit. Researchers are allowed a maximum of one cart at a time containing collections of interest. If you are interested in a sizable amount of material, you will need to prioritize which material you would like to request first.

For manuscript or written material, be aware that the NAA requests you remove one folder at a time from a document box or collections box and asks that you make sure to preserve the order of the folders. If you notice that any of the material is damaged, out of order, or missing please let the NAA staff know. For photographs and lantern slides, NMAI provides gloves for you to use when handling and consulting the materials.

It is also important to note that as the researcher, you will be asked to accept responsibility for returning all the contents to the correct folder or collection in the same condition they were delivered to you.

## Contract Researcher
We know that visiting the NAA in-person can be a challenge for many tribal communities, and as a result, a barrier to accessing the collections. An alternative option to an in-person visit is to hire a research surrogate already located in the DC area, who can visit the NAA and conduct research on your behalf. However, we know that this option may present a host of challenges; collaboratively, financially, or otherwise.

***If you would like to hire a contract researcher, we recommend getting in touch with an NAA staff member, as they may have a list of contract researchers in the area and can suggest to you. This applies to not only the Smithsonian Institution, but other archives and repositories as well.***

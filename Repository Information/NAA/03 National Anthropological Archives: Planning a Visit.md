The National Anthropological Archives is housed in the Museum Support Center (MSC), which is in Suitland, MD.

The Museum Support Center is the principal off-site conservation and storage facility for the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), but houses collections from several other Smithsonian institutions as well.

See the map below to get a sense of where it is in relation to NMNH, and the National Mall in Washington, DC.

## Transportation
Smithsonian Shuttle
* For researchers with an approved appointment request to visit NAA, the Smithsonian Institution provides a free shuttle between downtown D.C. and the NAA. There are two downtown DC pick up/drop off locations – in front of the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) on the side that faces the National Mall, and the corner of Independence Ave SW and 4th St SW (across the street from the National Museum of the American Indian). For researchers, we recommend the NMNH pickup location as it is easy to navigate to and has a designated sign labeled "Employee Shuttle Stop."
* The shuttle is scheduled to depart at the top of each hour from the downtown NMNH pick up location (although depending on the time of day it often will run late). The ride to/from Suitland is approximately 30 minutes.

Metro
* An alternative transportation option is the Suitland metro stop accessed via the green metro line. This requires a metro card (which can be purchased at any metro station) and costs roughly $4.25 (as of June 2022) one way (price is calculated by distance of the trip, so is subject to change based on start/end point). To get to/from the Suitland metro station to/from the MSC, it is approximately a 15-minute walk along a busy highway. See below for a map of the walking route:

* Upon arrival at the front entrance gate, let the guard know that you have a scheduled research appointment at the NAA. Using this option, the commute time from downtown D.C. is approximately 45 minutes.

Uber/Lyft:
* Rideshare apps are also a transportation option. Uber or Lyft costs approximately $40-60 one way, depending on the time of day. For drop off, let the guard at the front entrance gate know that you have a scheduled research appointment at the NAA. For pickup, a driver may come inside the gate and meet you at the front of the building. They will simply need to let the guard at the front entrance gate know that they are here for a researcher pickup.

Driving:
* The MSC has their own parking lots that are available for researchers to use at no cost. Upon arrival at the front entrance gate, let the guard know that you have a scheduled research appointment at the NAA. Once past the front gate, continue straight to reach the MSC parking lot. Researchers may park in either the upper or lower lot.

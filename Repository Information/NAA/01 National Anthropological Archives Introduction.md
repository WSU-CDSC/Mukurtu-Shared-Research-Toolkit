# National Anthropological Archives: Introduction

The National Anthropological Archive (NAA) is a world unto itself. From the vantage point of the reading room, it seems small yet mighty, especially when you consider that it holds one of the world's largest archival collections of Indigenous North American linguistic materials, and 13,000 cubic feet of collections from the four branches of anthropology.

Another impression you might get from the reading room is that it is deeply embedded in the history of the Smithsonian. The shelves are filled not just with old Smithsonian publications, but with material objects like cameras, old tins, and a trunk that had belonged to a late nineteenth century anthropologist. It is as if the reading room itself is an archive, or at the very least a nod to another era.

I share these details because they helped remind me that archives need to be understood on their own terms. They are of course institutions responsible for stewarding collections in a controlled, standardized way. But it can be easy to forget that they have their own particular histories, and that these histories can influence both your experience of the collections, and your ability to discover materials in them.

No one knows this better than archivists. When Clara and I arrived for our first day in a four-month rotation at the NAA, photo archivist Gina Rappaport, gave us several things. One was an organizational diagram showing where the NAA fits into the structure of the Smithsonian, and the other was a printout of an article called, ["The Rise and Fall of the Bureau of American Ethnography"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40170100?searchText=rise+and+fall+of+the+bureau+of&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Drise%2Band%2Bfall%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bbureau%2Bof%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A73f3fe885bf26221b856135a2d87f0db#metadata_info_tab_contents) (BAE) by Richard and Nathalie Woodbury. These both provided incredibly helpful framing for the research, and perhaps even a disclaimer. It was as if to say, you're going to encounter all sorts of oddities during your time here, don't be alarmed â€“ there's a reason!

**It's not you!**

Despite the tips and documentation regarding the NAA's institutional history, I still remember thinking in my first few weeks that perhaps I had missed something in my research methods classes. Did I really know how to do research, or was I just winging it? The reason I felt this way was because I was not finding collections relevant to the priorities defined by our tribal partners. For instance, I could not for the life of me find anything related to the Saginaw Chippewa. Not because there were no materials related to the Saginaw Chippewa, but because they were never labeled as such on the online catalog.

In retrospect, I realize this had more to do with my assumptions about how discoverable collection materials are, or rather, whether they were discoverable at all. In addition, I also attribute it to my not understanding just how poorly described Indigenous communities and traditional territories are in the archival record, particularly those dating back to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Things may be labeled with terms for broad culture groups or regions, but much rarer were those materials that named specific places, people, or communities. That level of specificity was not the point of the field research, particularly because that research was not done in service of or for the communities themselves, but rather the federal government of the United States.

This is all to say that this work takes a lot of sifting, and a lot of time. And while there is a lot you can do from off-site using the online catalog, the metadata available is often insufficient for identifying whether materials are relevant to a particular Indigenous community or place. I learned to operate under the assumption that there was almost always something to find. The question was just whether and how I was going to find it.

## Different Information in Different Places

To go back to the example of the Saginaw Chippewa, I had spent significant time searching the online catalog for materials related to the Saginaw Chippewa of Michigan and came across nothing. At some point, I decided to look at the card catalog in the reading room, where I found a card for a manuscript whose place was listed as "Saginaw, Mich." This same manuscript is listed on the online catalog, without the geographical identifier.

In addition, this manuscript was sent to the Bureau of American Ethnology with a set of photographs. Historically, objects, photographs, and manuscript material were managed differently, and so were separated from one another upon arrival at BAE (and the objects ended up in an entirely different department). There is no indication in the record that there are related materials elsewhere in the archives, but in looking through the Source Print Collection, I found a folder in the "Eastern Canada: Chippewa" section with Harlan Smith's name on it, including images that he had submitted with his manuscript.

Examples like this one are common. It's what happens when materials get described and then redescribed in other systems. Information gets lost, either because of human error, because it's not deemed important enough, or because (sometimes centuries!) old organizational systems break links between materials, such as was the case between Harlan Smith's related manuscript and photograph material. Unfortunately, it results in rendering materials difficult or impossible to find, especially considering how resource intensive research trips can be.

## Getting Help

One of the things I found most comforting during our time at the NAA was the support offered by the reference staff and archivists. They are aware of the challenges of navigating the archive, in part because they are deeply familiar with them, and have likely encountered similar challenges themselves. They are eager to help. They also are aware of the various places you might find important information about collection materials, whether those be in finding aids, subject guides, published materials, and can point you there.

Most importantly, don't be afraid to ask for help, and to ask often. A delayed response is not a sign of lack of interest in your topic. Often the folks answering reference questions are wearing many hats, and may just take some time to get back to you. It's also okay to be persistent.

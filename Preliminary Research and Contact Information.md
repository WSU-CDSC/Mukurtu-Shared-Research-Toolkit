## **Preliminary Research and Contact Information**

Do these institutions even have things you \*might\* be interested in? The short answer is probably 'yes.' When it comes to federal repositories with an extensive amount of collections, the question is usually how to go about finding those things.

First, there is a lot to look through! One of the greatest challenges in conducting research is _where to start._While the most straightforward answer might be to explore the online catalogs and institutional websites it can also be important to learn a bit about the history of the institution. Having a sense of an institution's early collecting practices, topics or regions of focus, and creation information will not only influence the kinds of materials held at each institution, but also give a sense as to how collections might be organized and discovered (or not).

It is important to note that not all collections or material will show up in the online catalog, so if you aren't finding anything that fits your research topic, it's always good to reach out to the reference archivist just in case! They also have knowledge of the specific constraints of digitizing a particular collection, which, as a researcher, is always good information to note.

**Online Catalogs**

One of the most important tools at your disposal as a researcher is a repository's online catalog. Whether you are working onsite or from a distance, they give some degree of access to a repository's holdings, or at the very least, the information necessary to inquire further about relevant materials with reference staff.

_They can also be confusing and vary drastically in their user friendliness._ In the month prior to our move to Washington, DC, several folks suggested we start by navigating online catalogs from a distance. While we give this same advice, it is important to mention that one of the things we ultimately found most helpful was to do walk-throughs of the catalog over the phone with reference staff. Why? Because the idiosyncrasies of a system are never obvious to the end user, and it is extremely meaningful to talk about those with people most familiar with them. Finally, repository websites _may_ also have information on searching their catalogues, so keep an eye out for that as well.

All of that said, it takes some amount of trial and error to figure out how to navigate online catalogues in a way that is most useful for you and your research. Don't be discouraged if you try a few searches that turn up few or no relevant results. Once you have a better sense of how things are organized in the catalog, then your search will likely change and become more specific to that particular archive, its history, and its holdings.

**Tips & Tricks to Searching Online Catalogs**

- Locating online catalogs
  - Where to find them from a general google search or from the institutional website
- Navigating online catalogs (Collections Search & SOVA & LOC)
  - Short demo video might be best way to explain this rather than a bunch of screenshots?
- Narrowing searches down
  - Using the "archival repository" or "type" or "culture" or "division" parameters on the online catalog
- Identifying digitized content in catalogs
  - For Smithsonian material - look for the blue box icon labeled "digitized content" next to the collection name
  - For Library of Congress material – look for a note in the catalog record or a media image will be included in the record
- Search terms (each institution will have their own specific search terms that work best)
  - Culture group, tribal community name, collector, artist, linguist, language, place name, geographical location

**Finding Aids**

- Finding Aids are another incredibly helpful tool for locating materials – most if not all, finding aids are available online (often via the online catalog) and copies can be printed or downloaded.
- Generally, all federal repositories will have some kind of a finding aid, although navigating and searching within the finding aid will vary depending on the institution, collection organization, and level of description. Finding aids are crucial – especially in large collections, and even more so when you are looking for very specific time periods, for instance, or locations.
- For us, one of the major takeaways for from working with these finding aids is that the sheer volume of materials in a collection can be extremely limiting in terms of description. So as researchers we often had to do a fair amount of preliminary research and then make some educated guesses when requesting materials.

**Subject Guides**

- Subject guides were another resource we used as a point of entry in our research process. Generally, all federal repositories will have some kind of subject guides (although they may not be available online or you might need to contact the reference staff for a copy).
- Depending on the institution, they often include a list of relevant materials divided by type of collection (e.g., vocabularies & grammatical notes, ethnology, photographs, moving image media).
- Since they are often focused (e.g., by tribal community), easy to navigate, and are essentially a comprehensive list of already identified material, they are a great place to start your research. For Native communities, they've been very useful, in that when they come for a visit, they often have a short amount of time that they want to use consulting materials they know have been identified with their community.

**Contact Information**

While it is always a good idea to do some preliminary online research, we also strongly recommend getting in touch with reference staff about your research subject. They are familiar with the idiosyncrasies of their repository, as well as relevant collections that may not come up in your search.

Each institution has a preferred method of communication for being in touch:

**The National Anthropological Archives:** All questions and inquiries should be directed to [naa@si.edu.](mailto:naa@si.edu) Questions and inquiries can also be made by phone at (301)-238-1310.

**National Museum of the American Indian – Archives Center:** All questions and inquiries should be directed to [nmaiarchives@si.edu](mailto:nmaiarchives@si.edu). If you are specifically interested in photographs, those questions can be directed to the photo archives at [nmaiphotos@si.edu.](mailto:nmaiphotos@si.edu)

**The Library of Congress:** All questions and inquiries can be made via the [Ask-a-Librarian general submission form](https://ask.loc.gov/#s-la-box-83050-container-tab0) on the Library of Congress website. If you have a sense of what type of materials you are interested in (e.g. manuscripts, photographs, maps, etc.) or regarding questions about materials you've already consulted, you can direct your question to a specific division. To do so, simply click on the "Ask a specialist" tab and then select the desired division.

The specific Ask-a-Librarian pages for the four Library of Congress divisions involved in the Mukurtu Shared Project are:

- AFC: [https://ask.loc.gov/american-folklife](https://ask.loc.gov/american-folklife)
- MSS: [https://ask.loc.gov/manuscripts](https://ask.loc.gov/manuscripts)
- P&P: [https://ask.loc.gov/prints-photographs/](https://ask.loc.gov/prints-photographs/)
- G&M: [https://ask.loc.gov/map-geography](https://ask.loc.gov/map-geography)

Please note that while using the Ask-a-Librarian service is the preferred method of communication, particularly if you are initiating contact with the LOC for the first time, there are often specific staff within each division that specialize in Native American collections (see the end of each above section). In your inquiry you can ask that your question be directed towards that particular staff member.

_ **Tips to Keep in Mind:** _ _While these email accounts are usually managed by a reference archivist, it is also possible that other staff members will be checking and responding as well._

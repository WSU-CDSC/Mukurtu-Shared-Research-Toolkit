**Research Best Practices:**

**Project Planning**

What is your end goal?

Most research projects will be defined by their end goal, whether that is to contribute to a community's digital collection, curriculum, museum exhibit, publication, etc. These goals will help guide the project and answer questions such as:

- what kind of research is required, and where.
- whether generating access copies of materials is sufficient, or if you will need higher quality scans

  - Most research projects will be defined by their end goal, whether that is to create an online curriculum, a museum exhibit, an academic publication, etc.
  - Asking this question will both help frame how you approach the project, and what kind of research is required.
  - Answering this question will determine whether access copies of primary materials are sufficient, or if you will need high quality scans, for instance. It will also help you know how much material you need, and how deeply you need to go into the material.

- Determine the scope of your project

  - Determining the scope of your project will also require a strong sense of what your resources you have available to you, I.e. do you have travel funds available if you need to visit an archive? How much time do you have to do the research?
    1. Time
      1.
    2. Staff
      1. Who is involved in both doing the research? Will you need to involve other departments
    3. Money
      1. Travel, Digitization expenses, Compensation
  - Will any collaboration or consultation with your organization or outside collaborators be required?

- Identify your research topic

  - Once you have identified your research topic, consulting secondary source materials can be particularly helpful in gaining historical or background information.
  - If you are unsure of how to narrow down your research topic, secondary source materials can also help serve as a guide for where to focus research or expand on an already identified research topic.

- Identify what kinds of records are of interest

  - Getting a sense of what kinds of records are of interest will help determine which repository to visit, what collections to identify, and where there might be gaps in collection descriptions. This will not only help structure the research itself, but also inform your research process.
  - If you can schedule a research visit to a repository, keep in mind that if your visit is short, knowing what you're looking for is key to using your time in the archives consulting collections rather than searching for them, or reading reference materials that might be available online or by request.

**Online Research**

- Identifying which repository has material of interest
- What's available from a distance?
  - Catalog
  - Subject Guides
    - Subject guides were another resource we used as a point of entry in our research process. Generally, all federal repositories will have some kind of subject guides (although they may not be available online or you might need to contact the reference staff for a copy).
    - Depending on the institution, they often include a list of relevant materials divided by type of collection (e.g., vocabularies & grammatical notes, ethnology, photographs, moving image media).
    - Since they are often focused (e.g., by tribal community), easy to navigate, and are essentially a comprehensive list of already identified material, they are a great place to start your research. For Native communities, they've been very useful, in that when they come for a visit, they often have a short amount of time that they want to use consulting materials they know have been identified with their community.
  - Finding Aids
    - Finding Aids are another incredibly helpful tool for locating materials – most if not all, finding aids are available online (often via the online catalog) and copies can be printed or downloaded.
    - Generally, all federal repositories will have some kind of a finding aid, although navigating and searching within the finding aid will vary depending on the institution, collection organization, and level of description. Finding aids are crucial – especially in large collections, and even more so when you are looking for very specific time periods, for instance, or locations.
    - For us, one of the major takeaways for from working with these finding aids is that the sheer volume of materials in a collection can be extremely limiting in terms of description. So as researchers we often had to do a fair amount of preliminary research and then make some educated guesses when requesting materials.

**Getting in touch with reference staff:**

- Finding out how to get in touch with reference staff is crucial. Unfortunately, it is not always obvious how to do so given that many repositories list info@ for an initial contact or have an anonymous system for receiving reference requests – such as at the Library of Congress. That said, once you \*are\* able to reach a human, you'll find that they are most often invaluable resources to you. They know the collections better than anyone else – their quirks, exceptions, potential cognate materials in other repositories, whether things are digitized, etc. They know who to ask if you have a question that they cannot answer, and they want to support the work you're doing.

- We know that folks can have all kinds of experiences in reference situations – some of which may not always be positive. Experiences in reference can be like an act of translation – and it can take time before both parties are on the same page. That said, the reference staff at each of the repositories we've worked with have become like colleagues and it's hard to imagine how we could have done this work without them.

**Tracking your research**

System for tracking research - it can be as simple as using your research notebook (making sure that is kept organized and clean) or a spreadsheet if you're working with a lot of metadata. Just a note, that if you are working with metadata, for a lot of archival materials, descriptive information and corresponding metadata is often impoverished and varies between collections and institutions.

**Access Copies/Reference Access copy photographs**

Not all archives permit photography – or if they do, there are usually parameters which you'll want to be aware of. In the case that you are photographing the collection, you'll want to make sure to capture the folder structure of the material – collection level, folder level, item level (if possible)

- Tip - often if you have little time in the archive, you might want to take many photos (assuming that is permitted) and spend your time reading once you get home.
- It is important to remember, too, that these repositories are federal agencies and come with a fair amount of bureaucracy. That might mean that things move more slowly given the chain of command and approval processes. It might also mean that the reference staff are working on a contract given how time-consuming and difficult it is to create federal positions. This is important to remember because it can be tempting to think (as it was for me) that federal archives have a lot of capacity, when it can be the opposite.
- It might be that you have feedback for reference staff regarding the materials you consulted or want to request items to be digitized. In either case, the repository likely has workflows for these, so if they are not explicitly stated on the website, just ask the staff what the best way to go about that is.

We recommend sorting your photos and file naming them while everything is still fresh in your mind – and doing so according to the folder structure so that you can trace your steps back to the item, cite it properly, etc.

**Note taking**

System for documenting research – these can take a variety of forms and be organized in a variety of ways, but whatever system you decide to use should be tailored to what works best for you and your own workflows. Examples include notetaking software such as OneNote (which we used), notebook, word document, spreadsheet etc.

**Processing Research Finding**

In many cases, you'll want to make sure you allot a good amount of time to dive into and read the materials you consulted, and, depending on your project, begin to synthesize your research findings. Depending on the amount of material consulted and the format, this stage of the research process can be the most time intensive, especially if you're working with manuscript material that may have handwriting that can often be hard to decipher or where several different topics are covered.

**Sharing Research Findings**

If you are doing collaborative research or are doing this work as part of a larger project and need to share back findings, it'll be important to figure out workflows for that as well. For instance, many of the PDFs you generate may be too large for email, so establishing ways to send and share documentation – in DropBox or otherwise – is going to be important.

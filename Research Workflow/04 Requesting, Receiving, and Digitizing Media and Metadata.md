# Requesting, Receiving, and Digitizing Media and Metadata.

Every institution has their own process for filling requests for digital files and metadata. Usually, repository websites include information about obtaining copies of material, but if you are interested in receiving associated metadata this may require a longer conversation with repository staff.  

If the material is undigitized, your first step will likely be initiating a digitization request. 

If the material is digitized and you would like access to digital files and accompanying metadata, your first step will likely be to contact the repository staff.  

For detailed workflows and information, see the [Mukurtu Metadata Transformation Toolkit](https://github.com/WSU-CDSC/Mukurtu-Metadata-Transformation-Toolkit/tree/main/Requesting%20Metadata%20and%20Media%20from%20Repositories).

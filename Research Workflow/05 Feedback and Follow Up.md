# Feedback and Follow Up 

The institutional metadata or information accompanying the material can often be incorrect, minimal, or even nonexistent. This is especially true for material relevant to tribal communities. Given the collecting history of these institutions, many of the materials held in their collections are minimally or even incorrectly described. More importantly, there is a lot of colonial and racist language both in the materials themselves and in the collection or item name, as well as misattributions and uncertain attributions.   

While conducting research, many community researchers may come across material they have additional and/or traditional knowledge of that may not be reflected in the existing institutional metadata. For example, a tribal member may be able to identify a previously unknown individual(s) in a photograph, provide a correction to the tribal affiliation or culture group given, or share knowledge about the material itself.   

In all cases, the National Anthropological Archives, the NMAI Archives, and the Library of Congress welcome any additional knowledge, information, or corrections tribal community members may feel comfortable sharing.  

Each institution has its own method for sharing this kind of information and providing this type of feedback. Please see below for the specifics of each institution:   

  National Anthropological Archives: The NAA has an “Information Please” form that researchers can fill out and return to a staff member with the information they would like to share. The form includes contact information, a description of the information you would like to share, and the corresponding material. The form is available in the reading room, simply ask the reference archivist for a copy, and it can be completed and returned during your visit.  

  National Museum of the American Indian – Archives Center: NMAI has an “Information Please” form that researchers can fill out and return to the Reference Archivist with the information they would like to share. The form is available in the reading room from the Reference Archivist. A downloadable copy is also provided here. Completed forms should be returned to the Reference Archivist.  

If conversations are ongoing or if additional follow-up is required, contact the staff member involved in the initial conversation directly via email.

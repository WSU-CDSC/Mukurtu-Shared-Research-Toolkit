# In-Person Research

First and foremost, the staff at all the repositories we conducted research in during our time on this project are welcoming, friendly and incredibly helpful.  Many staff members have been there for years and have an intimate knowledge of not only the collections themselves, but also the institutional and historical background that accompanies each collection and may not be included in the catalog record.  As researchers, we found this information to be extremely useful in locating additional or adjacent material of interest and/or cognate collections, and we highly recommend asking the staff questions about a collectionâ€™s particular history.   

In most cases the archives staff is small, but their connections with other departments, both within and outside of their institutions, are extensive.  If you have a question that falls outside the archives, the reference archivist can usually point you towards the best contact and is always happy to make an introduction.
